To establish a common rating system, I divided the numerator and the denominator of all the ratings. Most of the dogs had a rating score of over 1 because [they're good dogs brent](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent). Let's look at the dogs with the highest score rating (besides the American dog). We will look at which breeds of dogs have the highest scores. Since there are so many different breeds, I will focus on the top 50.\n",

Typical quarry included the gazelle, hare, fox, and jackal.\n",
